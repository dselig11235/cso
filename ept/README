popsummary takes the results from an ICMP scan and gnmap files as arguments 
and prints out javascript to populate open ports.  It tries to guess what to 
put in the "comments" field.  It also takes the list of "IPs scanned" and uses 
that list to add any missing IPs in the ICMP section.

I use xclip to copy it to the clipboard like so:
    xclip -i < <(popsummary.py "ICMP Echo Request.spl" *.gnmap)
and then paste it into the console tab of developer tools in Chrom(ium).
